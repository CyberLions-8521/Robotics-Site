## Contribution

The Cyberlions Robotics website is a student-run project for our team 8521. We are looking for talented individuals to help us build a website that is informative, dynamic, and easy to use. This does not neccessary mean you are coding, and we have roles for Software Developers and UI/UX Designers.

### Software Developer

If you're a software developer, it is recommended you have prior experience with HTML, CSS, and especially JavaScript. Additionally, you should have a basic understanding of how to operate Github. Our website is built under the React.js framework (made by FaceBook), which allows the reuse of components, including the reuse of HTML.

Don't worry if you don't know React.js, as we have resources and mentors in the team to help you learn. We recommend you ask either the programming lead or the O/M lead for more information before starting to code the website.

**If you're programming in react, clone the repository and run `npm install react-scripts --save`. This is a dependency that allows you to run the website locally using `npm start`.**

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This website is currently being deployed on GitHub Pages from the /docs folder. To properly deploy to GitHub Pages, run **`npm run build`** and copy the contents created in /build to /docs using **`cp -r build/. docs/`** after removing the previous /docs folder.
